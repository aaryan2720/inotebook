 # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a popular toolchain for building React applications. This README file provides a detailed overview of the project structure, available scripts, and step-by-step instructions to get you started.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── src
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── App.test.js
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.js
│   └── logo.svg
└── package-lock.json
```

- `node_modules`: This directory contains all the dependencies installed for the project. It is automatically generated and should not be modified manually.

- `package.json`: This file contains the project's metadata, including the name, version, dependencies, and scripts. It also specifies the Create React App configuration.

- `README.md`: This is the file you are currently reading. It provides documentation for the project.

- `src`: This directory contains the source code for the React application. It includes the following files:
  - `App.css`: The stylesheet for the application.
  - `App.js`: The main component of the application.
  - `App.test.js`: The unit tests for the `App` component.
  - `index.css`: The global stylesheet for the application.
  - `index.js`: The entry point of the application.
  - `logo.svg`: The application's logo.

- `package-lock.json`: This file contains the exact versions of all the dependencies installed for the project. It is automatically generated and should not be modified manually.

## Available Scripts

Create React App provides several scripts to help you develop and build your application. These scripts are defined in the `package.json` file.

### `npm start`

This script starts the development server. It watches for changes in the source code and automatically reloads the application in the browser. To start the development server, run the following command in the project directory:

```
npm start
```

The development server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### `npm test`

This script runs the unit
